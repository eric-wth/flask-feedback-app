# flask-feedback-app

This app is a basic flask app I wrote to illustrate the basics of developing an app with the flask framework.
The app receives data from a html form and saves it to a postgres database.

Technologies Used
Python: The backend server is implemented using Python.
Flask: Flask is a lightweight web framework used to build the application.
HTML/CSS: The form is built using HTML and CSS for styling.
SQLAlchemy: SQLAlchemy is used as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database interactions.
Postgres: The app uses Postgres as the database to store user information and feedback.
